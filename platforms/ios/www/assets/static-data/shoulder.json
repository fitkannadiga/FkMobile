The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint. The shoulder joint is the main joint of the shoulder.</p><p>In deltoid muscles, each origin gives rise to its own band of muscle fibers with the&nbsp;<strong>Anterior</strong>&nbsp;band forming at the clavicle, the <strong>Lateral</strong>&nbsp;fibers forming at the acromion, and the <strong>P</strong><strong>osterior</strong>&nbsp;fibers forming at the spine of the scapula. The bands merge together as they approach the insertion point on the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus.</p></div>",

The bar should travel close to your body, and you should keep your elbows out.</li><li >At maximum elevation, your feet should clear the floor and you should start to pull yourself under the bar. The mechanics of this could change slightly, depending on the weight used. You should descend into a squatting position as you pull yourself under the bar.</li><li >As the bar hits terminal height, rotate your elbows around and under the bar.
