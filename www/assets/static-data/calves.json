The two largest muscles within this compartment are known together as the calf muscle and attach to the heel via the Achilles tendon.</p><p>The gastrocnemius and soleus muscles taper and merge at the base of the calf muscle. Tough connective tissue at the bottom of the calf muscle merges with the Achilles tendon. The Achilles tendon inserts into the heel bone (calcaneus).</p></div>",
